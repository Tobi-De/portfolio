Welcome to my newsletter
I hope you are doing fine,
This newsletter serves my personal blog where I post programming tutorials and guides mostly about python and
Django. The main purpose of this blog to which you have subscribed is to serve as a notebook to me. I'm still a
student and I was looking for a way to save all the stuff I'm learning.As I learn and develop my programming
skills I will be sharing all my knowledge and experience through my blog posts.I hope you will learn something
from it. Feel to contact me for anything programming related using this link https://www.tobidegnon.com/get-in-touch/.
Best,
Tobi-De
